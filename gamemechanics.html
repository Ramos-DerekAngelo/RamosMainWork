      <th scope="row">Strongest Hero</th>
      <td colspan="10" class="justpadding">The techniques for the Strongest Hero are one of by far the Best to use<br> especially when your enemy has used his "Evasive". one of the few techs<br> you can use for this character are:<br> -Lordheaven (Popular)<br> -The Uppercut Tech<br> -The Shove Tech</td>

      <td>The Strongest Hero may be an all rounder but do<br> not try playing aggressive when it comes to playing<br> this character due to its skills where most of it are<br> close ranged and no skills that will grant you an<br> escape so its better to wait patiently for the enemy <br>rather than charging forward. its also advisable that <br>you should play passive when you're low health on The Strongest Hero</td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Hero Hunter</th>
      <td colspan="10" class="justpadding">About the techinique for this character. you must be good enough to<br> understand this. since this is more on being aggressive and predictive<br> rather than your typical characters in The Strongest Battlegrounds.<br> The few techs are right down here:<br> -Kyoto (Popular)<br> -Twisted Combo<br> -Humbled Grasp</td>

      <td>Hero Hunter may not be good for long ranges due<br> to its skills but it is very deadly when it comes to<br> close range fighting. so focus on forward attacks<br> and only fall back to assess the situation you<br> have done when fighting an opponent.</td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Destructive Cyborg</th>
      <td colspan="10" class="justpadding">This character specialize in long ranges judging from its 2nd to 4th<br> skills. this is mostly used to grind kills or just be annoying but here<br> are its techs:<br> -True One Shot (Easiest)<br> -Birdb Tech<br> -Forward Barrage</td>

      <td>For this character do not focus on close range combat,<br> this is a bad character to use when you're in a 1v1 due<br> to only having one close range attack and all of it will<br> be just long range. So try to not get into too much<br> fights when using this character</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Deadly Ninja</th>
      <td colspan="10" class="justpadding">This character does have techs of his own but not much people use<br> him due to how hard his techs are but these are the known ones in<br> the internet:<br> -Rando Combo (Easiest)<br> -Nethan Moves<br> -100% Damage</td>

      <td>This character may be known for his kill steal but let<br> me warn you, the more you learn this style the more<br> you realize how good it is. Dont waste your evasive<br> knowing almost all of the skills can be escape moves,<br> dont get cocky</td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Brutal Demon</th>
      <td colspan="10" class="justpadding">This character is by far the worst character you could ever face,<br> only the strongest people know why this character is hard to<br> beat because of his skills. The techs are:<br> -Brutal Tech (Popular)<br> -FadeUnchanged<br> -No Escape</td>

      <td>For this character you must be fast, once that player<br> use his evasive. He was already losing from the start,<br> focus on pressure on the opponent and make sure<br> he would never escape no matter what the cost may be.</td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Blade Master</th>
      <td colspan="10" class="justpadding">This character is just like hero hunter but more "All Rounder"<br> type of character, but focuses more on close combat.<br> It's techs are:<br> -Owner Combo (Popular)<br> -Lethal Tech<br> -Perfect Juke</td>

      <td>This character specialize in making you think that this<br> is weak but with the right use of his skills including his<br> special passive skill after killing an enemy will<br> guarantee your win in the future battles,<br> because hes always...one step ahead.</td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Wild Phychic</th>
      <td colspan="10" class="justpadding">Wild phychic is one of the most passive character in the whole<br> game due to it having an All Rounder skill this character is not<br> much used but it does well on 2v2'. The tech skills are:<br> -Wild Tech<br> -Duskroth<br> -Rock Tech</td>

      <td>This character is mostly used for fun because of it<br> having no close combat attacks and only ranged one<br> that make you pull the enemy towards you. So this<br> skill is very useful to runners that doesnt want to<br> fight, make sure you dont get stun locked because you missed your skill.</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Martial Artist</th>
      <td colspan="10" class="justpadding">The most useful character in 1v1's. This is like Hero Hunter's<br> rival when it comes to 1v1's but overall best in taking a lot of<br> people. It's techs are:<br> -"Basic" Tech<br> -Bonkid Dump<br> -Flying Tech</td>

      <td>This character is known for 1v1's too, but its down side<br> is that its easily counterable so expect a lot of people<br> that knows the character's weakness. Focus more<br> on defense while attacking brute force.</td>

    </tr>

      <tr>
      <th scope="row">Tech Prodigy</th>
      <td colspan="10" class="justpadding">The robotic human. This character isn't a cyborg but rather it<br> has a backpack filled with robot stuff so. I guess here are the<br> tech's for this early access character:<br> -Twin Rebound<br> -Humbled Prodigy</td>

      <td>Since this is a early access character, i myself do not<br> know but i do suggest running when he gets ult.</td>
